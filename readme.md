### Information

This is an adaption of the Analogy Clock for running in web browsers. Press 'i' to invert colors from black to white.

### Platform

This version is built to run on a Raspberry Pi, therefore a conversion from SWF to JS (Google Swiffy) was necessary due to performance issues. The original version (using flash) might be available later.
